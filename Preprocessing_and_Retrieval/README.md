# README

## Group 16 Information Retrieval Search Engine Project

This assignment submission includes a total of **three zip files**, each corresponding to a major component of the project:

1. **File1_Preprocessing_and_Retrieval**  
   Contains the preprocessing and document retrieval pipeline based on the ArXiv metadata dataset.  
   â†’ _This README belongs to this file._

2. **File2_API_and_GUI**  
   Contains the FastAPI-based backend and the user interface for querying the retrieval system.

3. **File3_Evaluation**  
   Contains evaluation metrics, scripts, and results to assess the performance of the retrieval system.

Each zip file includes its **own README** to explain the contents and instructions for running the code.

### File1_Preprocessing_and_Retrieval
This notebook performs the following tasks:

- Preprocessing of the ArXiv metadata dataset
- Filtering of computer vision (CV) papers from the `cs.CV` subcategory
- Implementation of the BM25 and Hybrid Method (BM25+MiniLM) for document retrieval

---

#### Note
- This notebook is designed to run on **Google Colab** without any modification.
- The notebook runs entirely within the Colab environment. There is no need to mount Google Drive. All intermediate and output files are saved to `/content/` during execution.

---

#### Outputs
The notebook automatically generates and processes several intermediate files during execution:

- `1_cs_cv_subcategories.csv`: Contains metadata for computer vision papers (`cs.CV`) filtered from the full ArXiv dataset.
- `2_lemmatized_data.csv`: Generated by preprocessing the abstracts in the previous file. This includes lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal, filtering of frequent and rare words, and lemmatization.
- `3_inverted_index.json`: Created after tokenization and inverted indexing on the lemmatized abstracts. This file maps terms to document IDs for fast retrieval.

These files are saved in the Colab environment under the `/content/` directory and are used internally by the notebook for the document retrieval process.
